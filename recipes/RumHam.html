<h3>Description</h3>

<p> Are you sick and tired of eating <em>'prerummed'</em> ham? I used to buy my hams prerummed,
but that was before I realized I could make my own quickly, easily, and just about <strong>anywhere!</strong>
We found this recipe from the self-help book <em>"7 Secrets of Awakening the Highly Effective Four-Hour Giant, Today"</em> by Charlie, Mac,
Dennis, Sweet Dee, and Frank.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 10-pound ham</li>
    <li>1 hunting knfe</li>
    <li> 3 1-liter bottles of Sailor Jerry's Rum</li>
    <li> 1 handgun </li>
    <li> 1 box handgun ammo</li>
    <li>1 bunch of Italian parsley</li>
</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>De-can ham (for instructions, see back of can).</li>
    <li>Using the hunting knife, carve a hole in the top of the ham wide enough to hold the mouth of a rum bottle.</li>
    <li>Open first rum bottle and upend it into your ham hole. If you made your hole deep enough, it should stand up there on it's own.</li>
    <li>Load gun.</li>
    <li>Open second rum bottle and upend it into your ham hole (the one in your face this time). As the liquid flows into your mouth, swallow at regular intervals.</li>
    <li>Repeat step five until bottle is empty.</li>
    <li>Open third bottle of rum and repeat step six.</li>
    <li>Remove safety from handgun.</li>
    <li>Wait for ham pirates.</li>
    <li>Shoot ham pirates.</li>
    <li>Reload gun.</li>
    <li>Repeat steps eight through eleven until rum has been fully absorbed into ham, usually about twelve hours.</li>
    <li>Garnish with parsley and serve.</li>
</ol>
