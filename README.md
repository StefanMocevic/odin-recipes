This project showcases the very basics of webpage design in the example of a recipe site. This webpage, in it's earliest format, showcases my ability to write boilerplate HTML, unordered lists, ordered lists, create relative links, and using elements such as 'strong' and 'em' to assign improtance to keywords and improve webpage accessibility to users who leverage assistive technologies.
